## Instruction
The topic of my engineering thesis is an application for Android devices that allows you to locate your mobile device and check the reading from the accelerometer and gyroscope. 
The value of the sensors can be read using the button in the menu. The application is to show the current indication from GPS satellite or telecommunication towers. 
The application shows the latitude, longitude and address. The application also allows you to send SMS and email for the current reading. When running in the background, 
it is supposed to save this data to a file, send SMS or email, depending on the user's preference. The user can also choose the time interval in which the activity 
will be performed.
